\maketitle

A group of dedicated readers wants us to develop a software system to help manage their electronic books.
The readers has not decided on what type of user interface that they will ultimately use.
Users will be able to create an account with the service, and edit their profile.
Each individual user will be able to add books to their library, with the possibility of multiple versions (file formats) for each book.

A user will be able to rate books, tag books, mark that a book is in a series, and give a book a description.
The user will can retrieve a book by title, author, or by what file formats are available.
Additionally, the software will be able to rank books by user's rating, average rating by all users, frequently looked at, and word count.
In addition to ranking books, authors may also be ranked by their books' average rating for the individual user as well as by all users.
