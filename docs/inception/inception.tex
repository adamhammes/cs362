\maketitle

A group of dedicated readers wants us to develop a software system to help manage their electronic books.
The readers has not decided on what type of user interface that they will ultimately use.
Users will be able to create an account with the service, and edit their profile.
Each individual user will be able to add books to their library, with the possibility of multiple versions (file formats) for each book.
A user can list all books in their library and all versions available to a specific book.

A user will be able to rate books, tag books, mark that a book is in a series, and give a book a description.
The user will can retrieve a book by title, author, series, or by what file formats are available.
Users will be able to rank books by their rating of a book and the average rating of all users for a book.
Authors and series can be ranked by a user's ratings of their books, and the average of all users' ratings of their books.
