\maketitle

A group of dedicated readers wants us to develop a software system to help manage their electronic books.
The readers has not decided on what type of user interface that they will ultimately use.
Users will be able to create an account with the service, and edit their profile.
Each individual user will be able to add books to their library, with the possibility of multiple versions/formats for each book.
