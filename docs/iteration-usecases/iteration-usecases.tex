% tabular takes one argument: a list of columns w/ their alignment (l, c, r)
% with optional pipes as column separators
\begin{tabular}{| r | l | l | l |}
  % \hline gives a horizontal line
  % The & separates columns; make sure to end each row with \\
  % It's not necessary to align everything like I did, but it greatly improves readability.
