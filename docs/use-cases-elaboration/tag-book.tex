\section*{Use Case}
 \begin{tabular}{l l}
 
Use Case:     & Tag Book \\
Actor:        & User     \\
Precondition: & None     \\
\end{tabular}

\section*{Main Success Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User provides a book title and a tag
    \item The system links the book to the tag and  acknowledges successful completion of the operation
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[1a.] Tag does not exist

    - System creates tag and links the book and new tag

    \item[1b.] Book does not exist
    
    - System returns operation unsuccessful
\end{itemize}

\section*{Information Expert}
The information expert for this use case is the System class. The System has
direct access to all of the tags and the books. These relationships make it the
most logical point to implement this functionality.


The method tagBook() will create a new instance of tag if needed, and link the
requested tag and book, and put all changes into the database.
