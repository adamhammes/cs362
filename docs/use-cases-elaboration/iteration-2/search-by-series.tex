\section*{Use Case}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Use Case:     & Search By Series\\
Actor:        & User \\
Precondition: & None \\
\end{tabular}


\section*{Main Success Scenario:}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item User provides id for series to search
   \item System returns a list of books belonging to that series

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Extensions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [1a.] No series exists with the given id

    - System indicates that the operation failed
                            
\end{itemize}


\section*{Information Expert}

The information expert for Search By Series is System, as it knows both Books
and Series, and Series, which knows what books it contains.
The searchBySeries method on System will call getSeries() on DB Support, then
getBooks() on the returned Series.
