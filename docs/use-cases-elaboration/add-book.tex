\section*{Use Case}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
  Use Case:     & Add Book    \\
  Actor:        & User        \\
  Precondition: & None \\
\end{tabular}

\section*{Main Success Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item User provides a unique id and title for the book to be added.
  \item System acknowledges that the book has been added.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item [1a.] Book ID is not unique

    - System indicates that the operation failed.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Information Expert}

The information experts for addBook are System (knows Users) and User (knows
Books).
This means that the addBook method assigned to Gradebook will get the User
instance from the database and then call the addGrade method assigned to User.
