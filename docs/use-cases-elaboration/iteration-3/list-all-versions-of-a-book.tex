\section*{Use Case}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Use Case:     & List All Versions of a Book\\
Actor:        & User\\

\end{tabular}


\section*{Main Success Scenario:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User provides a book id and the username
    \item System returns a list of all the versions of the specified book belonging to that user
 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Extensions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [1a.] No book by that Id found \\
         - System indicates it was unable to find that book
                            
\end{itemize}


\section*{Information Expert}
The information expert is System, and book. System knows and can retrieve book objects. Book objects intern know about versions, and can find requested versions.
