\begin{enumerate}
    \item User provides the book id, the format type, and the username for the book version they wish to access
    \item System returns the requested book version
 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Extensions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [1a.] No versions of this type exist for the specified user \\
         - System indicates that no versions were found
    \item [2.a] No book by that id exists \\
        - System indicates it was unable to locate that book
\end{itemize}
